Assignment: CodeIgniter : Basic

Build a program using CodeIgniter that allows the user to register and login. Once the user logs in, display a message that says that the user is logged in and display information about the user (email, first name, last name, password, created_datetime, etc). Have this be handled by a controller called "Login".

Check whether the email address already exists.

Validate the fields (check whether the email address is entered properly, check password's length - make it at least 8 characters) and perform xss_clean.

Allow the user to log off.

Encrypt the password before storing it to the database
